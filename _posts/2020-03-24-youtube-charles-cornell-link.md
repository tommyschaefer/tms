I really enjoyed this and thought the musical analysis was really interesting too. Many of the featured celebrities have committed resources to helping folks impacted by COVID-19, but Iâ€™m not sure the original video is all that helpful. Then again, maybe it brings attention to the situation and encourages folks to help?
