title: A commitment to writing

I recently saw [a tweet thread by David
Perell](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1241188844587945985?s=20) giving
tips on writing more. I've wanted to develop a writing habit for a while now,
but I always seem to get stuck, so I think this advice will be really helpful
for me! Here were a few pieces of advice that really spoke to me...

### Write about what you’re excited about.

> You don’t need a long-term writing plan. Just write about what excites you.
"Writing a novel is like driving a car at night. You can see only as far as your
headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way." — E.L. Doctorow

I try to write really polished and cohesive blog posts, but I tend to get
crushed by the self-imposed pressure. I should relax a bit and write about my
interests, even if they're disconnected.

### Stop trying to be original.

> You can build an audience and create tremendous value for the world by
building upon other people’s ideas. My favorite example is 
@FarnamStreet, an intellectual treasure inspired by Charlie Munger and Warren
Buffett.
>
> Everything is a remix.

 I've gotten better at this recently, but I still struggle with "but that's been
 done before" syndrome. Not everything needs to be original.

### Sprint, Don’t Jog

> If you want to be prolific, writing fast is as important as writing well.
Whenever you write, set an ambitious word count and a 60-minute timer. When the
timer goes off, stop writing. If you give yourself too much time to write, you
will procrastinate.

I'm a huuuuuge procrastinator. I think this will be especially valuable for me
to practice!
