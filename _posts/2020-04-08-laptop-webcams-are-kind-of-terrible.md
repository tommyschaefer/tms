> As Stern says, we obviously use the front-facing cameras on our iPhones and
even iPads more than we probably use the webcam on our Macs. Apple made a gamble
here, arguably skimping on a component that it didn’t think most people would
care about—and it might have continued to skate by on that for a while, if it
hadn’t been for all of us forced into video conferencing by the coronavirus
outbreak.

I totally agree that laptop webcams are quite terrible, but I also wonder
whether it really matters. We use the cameras on our smartphones to capture and
send high quality photos and videos with little-to-no compression, but 99% of
the videos we take on our laptops are heavily compressed and streamed. I
recently improved my camera setup at work, but I don't think anyone has noticed
through all of the Zoom compression.

If the front facing iPhone camera was only used for face time, could it
reasonably be lower quality? Would we take more laptop selfies if their cameras
were better?
