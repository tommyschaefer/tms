This post really rang true for me, and it's something I've been trying to be
mindful of recently. Nearly everything we create or do has some sort of
maintenance expectation, whether internal or external. All the excitement of
creating a thing tends to make me overlook the long-term consequences that are
involved. Instead, I'm trying to make concious decisions to either accept or
reject the maintenance burdens before committing to them.
