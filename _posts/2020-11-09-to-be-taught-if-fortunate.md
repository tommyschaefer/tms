One of my new favorites. I was drawn in from the very first sentence

> If you read nothing else we’ve sent home, please read at least this.

And I read it straight through. It’s an incredibly interesting and
wholesome story of exploration for exploration’s sake.

> I’m an observer, not a conqueror. I have no interest in changing other worlds
> to suit me. I choose the lighter touch: changing myself to suit them.

Like [Leave No Trace](https://lnt.org), but, you know, *in space*.

Highly recommend.
