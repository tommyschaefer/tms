Hi, I'm Tom. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer and animal lover currently living in Denton, Texas. I live with
my girlfriend, two cats, a bunny, and a fish. I work remotely, as the Director
of Software Development for [TEECOM](https://teecom.com)'s research and
development group, [TEECOMlabs](https://labs.teecom.com).

I'm primarily a Rails devleoper, but I really enjoy learning new programming
languages and technologies. I especially like when they change the way I think
about problems.

Some things I'm having fun practicing right now:

- Making bread
- Functional programming, primarily with Elixir
- Surgical suturing
- Tailwind CSS
- Making good pourover coffee
